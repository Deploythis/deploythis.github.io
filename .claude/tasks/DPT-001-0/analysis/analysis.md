# DPT-001-0: Content Management Strategy Root Cause Analysis

<analysis>
<executive_summary>
The Gatsby site currently suffers from tightly coupled content and presentation layers, with all text content hardcoded within React components. This architectural pattern prevents non-technical content updates and creates maintenance overhead. The root cause is an initial rapid prototyping approach that was never refactored to separate concerns. Migration to a content-driven architecture using Gatsby's built-in GraphQL layer and filesystem sourcing will enable scalable content management while maintaining performance and SEO benefits.
</executive_summary>

<complexity_classification level="MEDIUM">
<reasoning>This issue involves architectural changes across multiple components, GraphQL integration, and content migration without requiring system-wide refactoring. The existing MDX plugin infrastructure provides a foundation, but component modifications and content restructuring require careful planning and testing.</reasoning>
<workflow_recommendation>Standard investigation approach with focus on content architecture design and migration strategy to minimize deployment risk.</workflow_recommendation>

</technology_stack>
<architecture_patterns>
- Functional React components with hooks
- Default exports with named Head exports for SEO
- Global CSS with component-specific BEM-like classes  
- Static file sourcing for images only
- Custom head component for SEO metadata
- Container-based responsive layout system
</architecture_patterns>
<integration_points>
- GitHub Pages deployment via gh-pages package
- Custom domain (deploythis.co) via CNAME
- gatsby-plugin-manifest for PWA features
- gatsby-plugin-sitemap for SEO optimization
- Existing MDX plugin ready for content integration
</integration_points>
</project_context>

<root_cause>
<primary_issue>Content and presentation layers are tightly coupled due to hardcoded text content within React JSX components. All textual content (hero text, bio, skills, experience, contact info) is embedded directly in /Users/vhernandez/Work/deploythis/deploythis.github.io/src/pages/index.js and /Users/vhernandez/Work/deploythis/deploythis.github.io/src/pages/cv.js, preventing content updates without code modifications.</primary_issue>

- /Users/vhernandez/Work/deploythis/deploythis.github.io/src/components/_head.js: Lines 6 (hardcoded page title)
</file_references>
<code_patterns>
- Direct JSX text embedding: `<h1 className="hero-title">Frontend Developer / Creative Technologist</h1>`
- Hardcoded arrays in JSX: `<ul><li>Frontend Development</li><li>React & JavaScript frameworks</li>...`
- Static contact information: `<a href="mailto:victor@deploythis.co">Email</a>`
- Fixed SEO metadata without dynamic sourcing
</code_patterns>
<system_symptoms>
- Content updates require developer intervention and code deployment
- No separation between content versioning and code versioning  
- SEO metadata management scattered across multiple files
- Inability to leverage Gatsby's content optimization features
- No GraphQL data layer utilization for content
</system_symptoms>
</evidence>
<contributing_factors>
- Initial rapid prototyping approach prioritized quick deployment over scalability
- No content management strategy defined during initial development
- Existing MDX plugin configured but not utilized for content sourcing
- Missing content-specific gatsby-source-filesystem configuration
- No GraphQL queries implemented for dynamic content rendering
</contributing_factors>
</root_cause>

<technical_details>
<data_flow_analysis>
Current: Static JSX → React Components → Gatsby Build → Static HTML
Target: Markdown Files → GraphQL Layer → React Components → Gatsby Build → Static HTML

The current data flow bypasses Gatsby's content optimization and GraphQL layer entirely. Content exists only as hardcoded strings within component render functions, preventing any dynamic sourcing, transformation, or optimization.
</data_flow_analysis>
<dependency_mapping>
Content Dependencies:
- src/pages/index.js depends on hardcoded strings for hero, about, and contact sections
- src/pages/cv.js depends on hardcoded arrays for experience and skills data
- src/components/_head.js depends on static title configuration
- gatsby-config.js siteMetadata provides only basic site-level metadata

Component Relationships:
- Both page components import shared HeadContent and BeeLogo components
- Global CSS dependencies remain unchanged during content migration
- framer-motion animations tied to component structure, not content
</dependency_mapping>
<configuration_analysis>
Current gatsby-config.js Analysis:
- gatsby-source-filesystem configured only for images (./src/images/) and pages (./src/pages/)
- gatsby-plugin-mdx installed but no content directory configured for sourcing
- siteMetadata contains only title and siteUrl, missing description and other SEO fields
- No GraphQL schema customization for content types

Required Configuration Changes:
- Add content-specific gatsby-source-filesystem entry pointing to new content/ directory
- Enhance siteMetadata with comprehensive SEO fields
- Configure gatsby-plugin-mdx for content transformation
- Potential gatsby-transformer-json for structured data if needed
</configuration_analysis>

</technical_investigation>

<system_impact>
<affected_components>
Primary Components Requiring Modification:
- /Users/vhernandez/Work/deploythis/deploythis.github.io/src/pages/index.js: Complete content extraction and GraphQL integration
- /Users/vhernandez/Work/deploythis/deploythis.github.io/src/pages/cv.js: Experience data restructuring and query implementation  
- /Users/vhernandez/Work/deploythis/deploythis.github.io/src/components/_head.js: Dynamic SEO metadata integration
- /Users/vhernandez/Work/deploythis/deploythis.github.io/gatsby-config.js: Content sourcing configuration

New Components to Create:
- content/ directory with markdown files for each content type
- GraphQL fragments for content queries
- Content validation schemas (optional but recommended)
</affected_components>
<user_experience_impact>
No user-facing changes expected during migration. Site functionality, performance, and visual design remain identical. Post-migration, content updates will be faster and more reliable, potentially improving content freshness and SEO performance through easier maintenance.
</user_experience_impact>
<business_process_impact>
Current Process: Content Update → Developer → Code Change → Git Commit → Build → Deploy
Target Process: Content Update → Markdown File Edit → Git Commit → Build → Deploy

This removes the developer bottleneck from content updates while maintaining version control and deployment automation. Non-technical team members can update content directly through markdown files.
</business_process_impact>
<technical_debt_implications>
Current Implementation Creates Debt:
- Violation of separation of concerns principle
- Tight coupling between content and presentation
- Reduced maintainability as content volume grows
- Limited scalability for additional content types

Migration Reduces Debt:
- Implements proper content/presentation separation
- Enables Gatsby's built-in content optimization features
- Provides foundation for future content types (blog, portfolio)
- Aligns with Gatsby best practices and community patterns
