# External Context Integration - DPT-001-0

## Developer Notes Analysis

### Source Document: `dev-notes/DPT-001-0.md`

#### Task Overview
**Establish Content Management Strategy for Gatsby Site**

The developer has identified a clear need to separate content from code in the current Gatsby-enabled project. The goal is to enable content updates without modifying individual JavaScript/React files.

#### Current State Assessment (from dev-notes)
- **Project Type**: Gatsby static site with GitHub Pages deployment ✅
- **Content Location**: Currently hardcoded within React components (`src/pages/index.js`, `src/pages/cv.js`) ✅
- **Plugins**: MDX support available (`gatsby-plugin-mdx`) ✅
- **File Sources**: Images and pages configured via `gatsby-source-filesystem` ✅

#### Identified Content Types
1. **Personal bio/about content** - Currently in `src/pages/index.js`
2. **Skills and focus areas** - Hardcoded list in about section
3. **Experience/CV entries** - Located in `src/pages/cv.js` (needs analysis)
4. **Contact information** - Email, LinkedIn, social links
5. **Site metadata** - Title, description, SEO data

#### Strategic Objectives (from dev-notes)

##### 1. Project Context Gathering ✅ (Completed)
- [✅] Document current site architecture and content structure
- [✅] Identify all content that should be externalized from code
- [✅] Map existing content types (bio, skills, experience, contact info)
- [✅] Analyze current build and deployment workflow

##### 2. Content Isolation Strategy (Next Phase)
- [ ] Design markdown-based content structure
- [ ] Establish content directory organization (`content/` or similar)
- [ ] Define frontmatter schema for different content types
- [ ] Plan migration from hardcoded content to markdown files

##### 3. Implementation Plan (Implementation Phase)
- [ ] Configure additional `gatsby-source-filesystem` for content
- [ ] Create markdown templates for content types
- [ ] Modify existing pages to consume markdown content
- [ ] Implement dynamic content rendering with GraphQL queries

##### 4. Content Management Benefits (Expected Outcomes)
- **Non-technical Updates**: Enable content changes without code modifications
- **Version Control**: Track content changes separately from code
- **Scalability**: Easy addition of new content types (blog posts, projects, etc.)
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

#### Success Criteria (from dev-notes)
- All existing content moved to markdown files
- Site functionality maintained during migration
- New content can be added/edited without touching code
- Build process remains stable for GitHub Pages deployment
- Clear documentation for future content management

#### Technical Considerations (from dev-notes)
- Maintain existing styling and layout ✅
- Preserve SEO metadata and site performance ✅
- Ensure compatibility with current deployment workflow ✅
- Consider future content types (blog, portfolio, etc.) ✅

### Technical Integration Points

#### Existing GraphQL Usage
- Currently no GraphQL queries detected in pages
- gatsby-source-filesystem configured for images and pages only
- Ready for content integration via additional filesystem source

#### SEO and Performance
- Custom Head component (`src/components/_head.js`) handles SEO
- Gatsby's built-in optimizations for images and performance
- Manifest plugin configured for PWA features

### Content Migration Priority

#### High Priority (Core Content)

5. **Hero Content** - Title, subtitle, value proposition

#### Future Consideration
6. **Experience/CV Content** - Professional history (needs CV page analysis)
7. **Portfolio Items** - Future project showcases
8. **Blog Posts** - Future content expansion

### Constraints and Requirements

#### Must Maintain
- Current visual design and styling
- GitHub Pages deployment workflow
- Performance and SEO optimization
- Mobile responsiveness

#### Must Enable
- Content updates without code changes
- Version control for content
- Easy addition of new content types
